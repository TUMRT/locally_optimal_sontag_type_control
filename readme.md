# Inverted Pendulum Example for Locally Optimal Control Based on Sontag-Type Controller

This code is used to symbolically generate locally optimal Sontag-type controllers, as well as implement and benchmark them.
The code is provided "as is".

## How to generate controller and run simulations
1. Generate and save the controllers by running `generate_controllers.py`. The generated expressions should appear as files in the folder `generated`.
2. Then, to run a simulation, run `_main.py`, or to run a set of performance comparison simulations, run `performance_comparison.py`, to show them, run `performance_comparison_plots.py`.
