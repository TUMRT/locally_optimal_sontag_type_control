## How to generate controller and ru simulations
1. Generate and save the controllers by running `generate_controllers.py`. The generated expressions should appear as files in the folder `generated`.
2. Then, to run a simulation, run `_main.py`, or to run a set of performance comparison simulations, run `performance_comparison.py`, to show them, run `performance_comparison_plots.py`.
